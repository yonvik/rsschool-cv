3. Since childhood I was fond of science and electronics. I was curious and tried to find out how things work around me. Later I focused on PC learning and dreamed to become a developer one day. In Crimea, where I was born, I didn't have an opportunity to fulfill my dream and I went into ship building sphere. Now I live in Saint-Petersburg, build ships, but I never forget who I really wanted to be. This idea gives me a strong motivation to learn. I am purposeful, I am not afraid to ask questions if I don't understand something or look for answers on my own. My goal is to become an effective part of a team of professionals, to learn, grow, and achieve new heights together.
